# Labrynth Creator
Labrynth Creator allows the player to draw a maze on a sheet of paper and play it in virtual reality. The user fills in boxes on graph paper, drawing them on a 20x20 grid with a starting point at the bottom and finishing point at the top. They hold the sheet of paper up to the camera in the first screen, aligning it and making sure the digital maze matches the analog maze. When satisfied, they click to advance with an option to re-do the calibration if they choose. Next, the player is transported to the start of the virtual reality maze that they created, holding a flashlight into a hole between two walls in front of them. The only sounds are the creepy soundtrack, Uoon II by Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and their footsteps. The goal is to reach the other side of the maze and enter the portal, taking them to a beach and winning the game.

This project was made with p5.js, A-Frame, and Craig Kapp's p5Aframe library.
